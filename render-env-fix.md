# ðŸ”§ Fix Render Keepalive - Add Missing Environment Variable

## Problem
Your RENDER_URL environment variable is not set, so keepalive pings never run!

## Solution

### Step 1: Your Render Service URL
Your attendance bot URL: `https://attendance-bot-1dr6.onrender.com`

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable
1. Go to [render.com dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your attendance-bot service  
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add new environment variable:
   - **Key**: `RENDER_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://attendance-bot-1dr6.onrender.com`
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## Expected Result
After deployment, you should see these logs every 3 minutes:
```
ðŸ”„ Keepalive ping successful
ðŸ”„ Business hours ping successful (during 9 AM - 6 PM IST)
```

## Verify It's Working
1. Check logs for keepalive messages
2. Visit: `https://attendance-bot-1dr6.onrender.com/` - should show:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "alive",
     "keepalive": "enabled"
   }
   ```

## Why This Happened
The environment variable was missing, so this condition failed:
```javascript
if (RENDER_URL) { // undefined = false, so keepalive never started
    // keepalive logic here
}
```
